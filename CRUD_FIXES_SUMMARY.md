# CRUD Functionality Fixes for Business Partners, Field Trainings, and Expenses Report

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **HTML Form Structure**
- ✅ Added proper `<form>` tags around all three forms
- ✅ Added hidden fields for `record_id` and `agentName` in each form
- ✅ Added proper form status elements for save feedback
- ✅ Fixed button types (changed to `type="button"` for add buttons)

### 2. **JavaScript Setup Functions**
- ✅ Added `setupExpensesForm()` function
- ✅ Added `setupPartnersForm()` function  
- ✅ Added `setupClientsForm()` function
- ✅ These functions properly initialize form fields with agent data
- ✅ Updated page navigation to call setup functions instead of just load functions

### 3. **External Script Integration**
- ✅ Added setup function calls in `script_enhanced.js`
- ✅ Functions properly integrate with existing `saveFormData()` and `loadFormData()` functions
- ✅ Proper error handling and status updates

### 4. **Google Sheets Integration**
- ✅ Verified `Code.gs` already has proper sheet definitions
- ✅ All three forms map to correct Google Sheets:
  - `expensesForm` → 'Expenses to Income Report' sheet
  - `partnersForm` → 'Potential Business Partners' sheet
  - `clientsForm` → 'Potential Field Trainings' sheet
